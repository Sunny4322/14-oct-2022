		Brock Edward Lesnar is a popular American wrestler, football player, and mixed martial artist. Currently signed with ‘World Wrestling Entertainment’ (WWE), he is the former ‘WWE’ universal champion. Born and raised in Webster, South Dakota, Brock became an amateur wrestler and a skilled footballer while he was in high school. He was a two-time state champion in amateur wrestling. He joined ‘WWE’ in 2000 and became the youngest ‘WWE’ champion at the age of 25. He also became the second quickest wrestler to win the championship in ‘WWE’ history. In 2004, he put his wrestling career on hold to pursue a career in the ‘National Football League.’ He signed with the ‘Minnesota Vikings,’ and played several preseason games for the team. In 2006, he also joined K-1’s mixed martial arts league. Apart from making a cameo appearance in the American biographical sports crime drama film ‘Foxcatcher,’ Lesnar has also been featured as a cover athlete for many video games, such as ‘WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain,’ ‘WWE 2K17,’ and ‘UFC Undisputed 2010.’ Lesnar was once arrested on suspicion of possessing anabolic steroids. The charges were dropped when the drugs were ascertained as legal growth hormones.

		Brock Lesnar's accolades in amateur wrestling opened the doors for him to sign his first contract with WWE in 2000. He got assigned to the promotion's then developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling, where he met his future friend and manager Paul Heyman and paired up with his friend and college roommate Shelton Benjamin. He also worked with future WWE superstars like Randy Orton, John Cena, and Batista.

He competed in various live events and dark matches between October 2000 to March 2001 before the promotion decided it was time for him to make his main roster debut
